# How the migration script was done
The idea was to take the SQL DUMP which has a structure close to python tuple when it comes to populate data
and to transform this data population script from SQL to a list of Python tuple, each tuple being a line in the old
database. Then one has to map this data with the new models and voil√†.

Note that organization if the old schema are not the same as new organization as they are in fact service providers.
